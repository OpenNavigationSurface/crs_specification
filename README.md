# ONSWG sub-WG on CRS
Working space for a subgroup to improve the BAG coordinate reference system specification

This group was formed after a discussion at the 2022 Canadian Hydrographic Conference where the future of how the coordinate reference system(s) should be stored in the BAG file format.  The discussion prepatory material can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenNavigationSurface/crs_specification/blob/main/docs/2022-05-19_ONSWG_VerticalDatumSpecification.docx) and the meeting minutes from CHC 2022 can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenNavigationSurface/crs_specification/blob/main/docs/onswg_mtg_2022-06-09.docx).
